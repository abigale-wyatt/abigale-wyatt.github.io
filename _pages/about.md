Hello! I'm Abigale.

I am currently a PhD candidate in [Resplandy group](http://resplandy.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University. 

My current research examines how ocean physics and climate variability impact surface ocean biogeochemistry. My interests include biogeochemical ocean modeling, coupled models of ocean and climate interaction, upper ocean ecosystem dynamics and nutrient cycling, biological carbon export and the biological carbon pump. 

I am also very interested in teaching, outreach and science communication in general.
