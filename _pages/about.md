Hello! 

I'm Abigale Wyatt.

I am currently a PhD candidate in [Resplandy group](http://resplandy.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University. 

My research interests include biogeochemical ocean modeling, coupled models of ocean and climate interaction, upper ocean ecosystem dynamics and nutrient cycling, biological carbon export and the biological carbon pump. 

I am also very interested in teaching, outreach and science communication in general.
