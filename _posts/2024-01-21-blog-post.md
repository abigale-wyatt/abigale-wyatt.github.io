For the past few years, I've been using the En-ROADS simulator inside and outside the classroom to teach some of the challenges of climate policay.
I wrote an article for  Princeton Highwire Earth about a recent experience running the "Climate action simulation" 
with the Princeton Energy and Climate Scholars (PECS). Check it out
