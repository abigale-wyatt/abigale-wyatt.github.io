This summer, I got a group of Princeton graduate students from the Geosciences department and Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences 
program to put on rotating tank experiment demonstrations at the Independence Seaport Museum in Philadalphia.
The tank set up is this really cool, low-cost design created by DIYnamics that was really approachable to guests.

When their team heard we were using their setup, they invited me to write a guest blog post 
<a href="https://diynamics.github.io/blog/philly-museum-2019.html">here</a>. 


Check it out!
