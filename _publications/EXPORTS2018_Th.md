title: "High-resolution spatial and temporal measurements of particulate organic carbon flux using thorium-234 in the northeast Pacific Ocean during the EXport Processes in the Ocean from RemoTe Sensing field campaign"

excerpt: 'More than 950 measurements of thorium-234, the naturally occurring radionuclide used as a tracer of sinking particle flux, were made during Augustâ€“September 2018 at Ocean Station Papa in the northeast Pacific Ocean. High-resolution vertical sampling enabled observations of the spatial and temporal evolution of particle flux in Lagrangian fashion. This work sets the foundation for understanding controls on the biological carbon pump during this EXPORTS campaign.'
